GPT_ArabidopsisLeafModel_20120207
Last version was accepted, renewed clean up to make sure everything is fine. 

GPT_ArabidopsisLeafModel_20111213
Hopefully final version of the paper. Cleaned up and all correct. 

GPT_ArLeaf_PaperResubmission_20111211
Try and make the principal growth directiosn in the model even better by: increasing plam at early stages? 
by reducing mid span and maybe by increasing the gradient of lam. 

GPT_ArLeaf_Paper_20110722
Same as before but without POL decay when DISTORG is present. 

GPT_ArLeaf_Paper_20110712
Cleaned up version for the paper. Also things were renamed and moved. 

GPT_ArLeaf_20110621
More elements (now 1872, previously 1120). 

02/06/2011 GPT_ArLeaf_20110602
Cleaned up version of the nearly finished model for the paper. 


22/05/20110 ArLeaf_ThesisChap2_110522
Make figures for the thesis. 

06/05/2011 ArLeaf_RT-LATE2_110506
LATE2 (another age factor) comes in to arrest growth in width a little later than the original age factor. 


17/03/2011 ArLeaf_ProxRTnorim_110317
Cut out rim and midvein to see how cells look and directions. 


28/03/2011 ArLeaf_ProxNamesRT_110228
Now growth will be calculated in real-time. Therefore rates will have to be higher. 
Also, Kper needs to receive more of a gradient to make the karea look better. 


24/02/2011 ArLeaf_ProxNames_110225b
Same model as before, just with the right names, as used in the paper description. 


22/02/2011 ArLeaf_ProxPol2_110225b
Do not fix the polarity from the beginning, but make the threshold lower. Also, let POL euilibirate before starting,
at least a little bit. 

25/01/2011 ArLeaf_Prox_110125b
Better model, where age is increasing over time. 

19/01/2010 ArLeaf_Prox_110119
Improvement from the 18b model, as the size is not quite right. 

21/12/2010 ArLeaf_ProxDrop_101221
Drop Prox levels over time. Prox has a linear start and does not diffuse. Keeping the model
simple again. Lam will increase over time so adjust the anisotropy patterns. 

14/12/2010 ArLeaf_1YouthPhaseC_b_101214
the previous model is pretty good, but the leaf is a little smalle at the end of Phase B still. 
Everything else looks pretty good though. Now the Prox gradient will be made a little more
shallow again, to see if the leaf can get bigger again. 

14/12/2010 ArLeaf_1YouthPhaseCDrop_101214
Keep width the same throughout. Only drop length and only in phase C. 

13/12/2010 ArLeaf_2YGradLin_adjust2_101213
In the last one the model has not actually been adjusted. This will be done here, where the drop in 
length will be lessened. 

13/12/2010 ArLeaf_2YouthsGradLinear_adjusted_101213
Adjust freely the linear drop to match the data, i.e. at least phase B. 

02/12/2010 ArLeaf_2YouthGradLinear_101202
The prox gradient is steep to fit the 1D profile better. Here growth rates will drop linearly. This means
that leaf growth cannot be model throughout development, but can only account for the phases shown here,
but this will be a priminary look. 


01/12/2010 ArLeaf_2YouthsSteepGrad_101201
the last model has been adjusted. However, the tip is still very strong. Also the 1D profile is simply not curved. 
For this we would need a steeper prox gradient. The prox gradient will be adjusted in this model. 

24/11/2010 ArLeaf_LamOnly2Youth_101124

2 youth factors instead of 1, allows bettwe adjustment of the model.
